# CRUK technical exercise (React)

## Task details

- We will be testing your ability to understand an existing React/Typescript codebase understand what is already and build what is not
- You will be building a form using the CRUK React Component Library and a form library of your choice such React Hook Form or Formik and a validation library of your choice such as Zod or Yup.
- This form which will fetch assets from the NASA Images and Video Library API The fields described below will modify the search query.
- The media returned should be displayed in list below the form, these may be images, video, or audio clips. It is up to you how you display these
- The user should only see the first 10 items on the page. If you have time, getting this working with some form pagination is a stretch target.
- Code must be clean and production ready, quality is better than quantity.
- Feel free to edit this readme or add a new readme file for any additional information, such as what you might do improve your application in the future.
- Please do not attempt to push to this repo, ideally we would like you to create your own fork.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
