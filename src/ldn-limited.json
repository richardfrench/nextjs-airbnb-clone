We look forward to welcoming you one of our super  home from homes.\r\n\r\nWe know Fitzrovia well and can thoroughly recommend it for its central London location, great transport links (although you'll probably be mostly on foot as tourist London is very walkable!) and wide choice of bars and restaurants. It's a highly desirable neighbourhood with beautiful architecture and interesting streets. People come from all over London to enjoy some Fitzrovia life. We're lucky enough to be based here and hope to see you here too! \r\n\r\nWhen we want to head out of the city, Lymington is our favourite getaway location. You'll love this quaint seaside town on the edge of the beautiful New Forest. \r\n\r\nWe have been letting our properties for over 15 years. We hope we've perfected a warm and professional welcome. Really importantly, you can book with us worry-free. As you'll see from our vast number of reviews, we offer a friendly, guest-focused, helpful and absolutely reliable service.  \r\n\r\nWe're very happy to help with questions (before or during your stay) or to tailor any trip to suit your needs so just let us know if there's anything we can do. We look forward to seeing you in London or Lymington!",

I have lived in the area for over seven years now and I can honestly say it's one of the best places that I've lived in the Capital [and there's been quite a few!]. I'm also a seasoned traveller and like to think I have a good feel for what guests are looking for in a travel accommodation experience.\r\nYour independent en-suite bedroom is like a small apartment and occupies a whole single floor of my house. It has its own lockable door and is directly accessible from the staircase. You also get the front door key. So you are completely independent. I live in one of the apartments, so if you want privacy and security here you have it or if you fancy a beer i can show you some local bars, restaurants and tourist sites.\r\nIn short you get a high quality en-suite double bedroom apartment, a bit like a hotel suite [linen, towels and toiletries are included and the bedroom is cleaned and prepared by a professional cleaner]. All at exceptionally competitive rates.",

I live aboard one and offer the other JESSIE (named after my late mother) for interested people to stay on while visiting London. I've made the boat as comfortable as possible and love to stay on her myself whenever I can. She has a great central position on the canal at Little Venice and I am never too far away on my other boat if needed. I enjoy sharing the fun of boats. \r\nYou'll get a warm welcome on JESSIE. ",

This is one of the reasons why I am often out of town. I have studied finance in France and in Spain and have worked in the finance industry until last September. \r\n\r\nI love travelling in South America, especially in Uruguay. Most of my family lives there. The beaches are incredible, and the food is out of the world.  \r\n\r\nI cannot live without eating that is the least to say and I cook a lot but London has the best places to eat... ask me if you need advise!  we are lucky in London for that  ... And I cannot live without going to pineapple dance studio in London, they have some great classes too - you can learn anything  ... Bollywood dances and Flamenco for instance. \r\n\r\nI got this place last year, and I am sad I cannot live in it as much as I want to- this is why I want others to get the chance! \r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nTania",

Throughout different time in the day and weekend the demographic in the streets is in a constant state of flux. It is lively and urban but at the same time friendly and neighbourly.

There are always people on the streets 24/7 which adds to this feeling and night buses stop right at the end of our street.",

For the past 20 years Elisa has been a yoga instructor, teaching private and group classes mainly in Kensington and Notting Hill. Dominic is a professional sailor who also does renovation work when not at sea. Together have 5 children aged between 25 and 33 - who have all now flown the nest.\n\nWe enjoy people, sunshine, sailing and family. We run yoga and sailing holidays around the world including regular retreats in Kerala in India, UK, Turkey, Italy, Greece and Spain.\nWe have been hosting guests in the spare bedroom in our home since 2010 and it has proved to be a really enjoyable experience. \n\nWe have enjoyed meeting so many people from all over the world and getting to know them a little during their stays with us. \n\nWe have ourselves been guests in a number of Airbnb home rentals  in Iceland, Wales, France and Spain. \n\nThere is something rather special about staying in a less touristy location and experiencing a place with the personal touch of staying in a home with local people as their guests rather than a generic hotel room. However we also understand the importance of retaining that sense of privacy we all appreciate.\r\n\nFor many years we used to swap homes with other families in Europe & the US. We enjoyed the mutual respect between ourselves and our exchange partners to be respectful of each other's property.  When in the summer of 2012 London hosted the Olympics, Airbnb encouraged their spare room hosts to rent out their whole home to visitors coming to the city.  It wasnt uncharted territory for us to trust strangers to look after our home so we decided to give it a try.  \n\nEven with the financial exchange involved, we have enjoyed a trusting relationships with our guests. They understand that this is our family home and not an impersonal investment rental property.  Its been great to hear their feedback as to how much they have enjoyed living in our diverse London neighbourhood and weve truly appreciated the pride consecutive guests have taken in looking after our home. \n\nThis positive experience encourages us to continue to rent our home as part of a lifestyle shift that we have embarked upon in recent years.  \n\nWe have regularly house/pet sat for friends, neighbours and extended family. Now when our home is rented we take on short, medium and long term housesits in the UK and Europe.",

For the past 20 years Elisa has been a yoga instructor, teaching private and group classes mainly in Kensington and Notting Hill. Dominic is a professional sailor who also does renovation work when not at sea. Together have 5 children aged between 25 and 33 - who have all now flown the nest.\n\nWe enjoy people, sunshine, sailing and family. We run yoga and sailing holidays around the world including regular retreats in Kerala in India, UK, Turkey, Italy, Greece and Spain.\nWe have been hosting guests in the spare bedroom in our home since 2010 and it has proved to be a really enjoyable experience. \n\nWe have enjoyed meeting so many people from all over the world and getting to know them a little during their stays with us. \n\nWe have ourselves been guests in a number of Airbnb home rentals  in Iceland, Wales, France and Spain. \n\nThere is something rather special about staying in a less touristy location and experiencing a place with the personal touch of staying in a home with local people as their guests rather than a generic hotel room. However we also understand the importance of retaining that sense of privacy we all appreciate.\r\n\nFor many years we used to swap homes with other families in Europe & the US. We enjoyed the mutual respect between ourselves and our exchange partners to be respectful of each other's property.  When in the summer of 2012 London hosted the Olympics, Airbnb encouraged their spare room hosts to rent out their whole home to visitors coming to the city.  It wasnt uncharted territory for us to trust strangers to look after our home so we decided to give it a try.  \n\nEven with the financial exchange involved, we have enjoyed a trusting relationships with our guests. They understand that this is our family home and not an impersonal investment rental property.  Its been great to hear their feedback as to how much they have enjoyed living in our diverse London neighbourhood and weve truly appreciated the pride consecutive guests have taken in looking after our home. \n\nThis positive experience encourages us to continue to rent our home as part of a lifestyle shift that we have embarked upon in recent years.  \n\nWe have regularly house/pet sat for friends, neighbours and extended family. Now when our home is rented we take on short, medium and long term housesits in the UK and Europe.",

    "description": "A double room in a stylish and quiet flat, my place isn't in tourist London, so you can live like a real Londoner for your days here! But it isn't far to the centre with public transport. There's a full description below, but don't take my word for it, check out the 130+ positive reviews!<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />Hi there!<br />My place is a two bedroomed architect-designed apartment, in a lovely street of little houses. A double room is available, for a maximum of two people. You will share the apartment with me, Matthew.<br />Like London, the place is modern on the inside but old on the outside!<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />WHAT IS YOURS: Your room has a double bed (140cm wide), with lots of storage and a desk. The bed is made up with linen, and towels are provided, and there is a hairdryer and a European socket adaptor<br />WHAT IS SHARED: You share with me the open plan living room with high, roof-lit ceiling, and a piano if you want to play!<br /><br />Please feel f",
    "neighborhood_overview": "WHERE: The apartment is in Southwark, south of the Thames. To be clear, this location is 16 mins walk from the Underground at Elephant and Castle, is not in tourist London and not right next to nightlife and shops. If you want to roll out of bed right in the middle of town next to an underground station, then this is not the place for you. The area is a residential area just south of the centre of London.<br /><br />So if you need somewhere comfortable, clean, sunny, and quiet, that is easy to get into town from, in an interesting multicultural area where real people actually live, then this apartment is great!<br /><br />Central London is pretty big. Yet thanks to the bend in the river Thames, the flat is equidistant to most places of interest - Westminster, Soho, the West End, Covent Garden, and the City of London are a short bus journey away. <br />The area isn't London's most glamorous, but it is convenient. <br />Local facilities are great for buying provisions. Not only are good",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Crouch End and environs <br />Crouch end is a great area. Many of its population come from the creative industries; television, music, film, theatre and publishing who are drawn to the area for its laid back atmosphere and cafe society. The nicest thing about the area is that there are mainly independent shops rather than chains. Shopkeepers know the locals by name and it gives the area a more eclectic vibe. It's popular with young people and with families so it has something for everyone.<br /><br />You will never go hungry in Crouch End! There are so many good cafes and restaurants, all very reasonably priced. Whatever kind of food you like, you will find it within a mile of the flat. But mostly just a five minute walk. I can recommend places based on your tastes so please ask.<br /><br />There are two great cinemas just five minutes walk from the flat.<br /><br />There are also four supermarkets and dozens of small food shops open til late, organic shops, butchers, fishmongers and w",

I've travelled a great deal; Europe, North and South America and much of Asia and have friends all over the world. \n\nI have just bought a beautiful holiday home near Ficulle, Umbria. It has one bedroom, kitchen /diner/living room /garden /shared pool and sleeps 4. It's in a stunning area rich with art, history, food and nature. Hilltop cobbled stone villages, natural lakes, festivals and glorious scenery make it a fabulous place to visit all year round. \n\nI love London. It's a great city that offers something for everyone. You'll want to see all the main sights like Buckingham Palace, the houses of parliament, the Tate galleries and Big Ben but if you really want to experience London, then there's nothing better than staying with a local. I'm a big foodie, as are many of my friends, and London's cafes and restaurants are some of the best in the world. I'm a bit of a culture vulture and to me that means everything from local markets to galleries, small music venues and pop up shops. I like the quirky, the revealing as well as the traditional.   I have a sense of humour, enjoy good conversation and plenty of laughs. \n\nI'm used to having people staying and I visit friends regularly. I like to feel at home wherever i go and my home is the kind of place you can relax.",

We hope to be able to point you to the best foodies places, the unique markets and even the gems in the touristy spots.  <br />If you are not here to sight-see but are looking for a temporary home whilst you set yourselves up in this lovely city we now call home, we hope to be able to point you to all the various neighbourhoods in London (as between us, I think we've lived pretty much all of London!) and provide you with as much guidance and assistance as you wish.<br /><br",
    "neighborhood_overview": "The neighbourhood is extremely convenient for someone like me who doesn't drive as I am never more than one hour away from anywhere in London that matters to anyone due to the amazing transport links we have available.<br />The river is a mere 5 minutes away and that provides for a very relaxing riverside walk especially during the long summer months and there is also a children's playground just across the road.  <br />My favourite green space is Bishop's Palace and Bishop's Park which is a 15/20 minute walk away and that almost does not feel like you are in Central London.<br /><br />There are also numerous cheap eats and independent cafes not more than 5 minutes walk away - so extremely convenient for grabbing a quick bite.  For something very special the River Cafe is just a skip and hop away.",

    "host_about": "Hi, I'm Simon. Welcome to a collection of self contained studio suites located in one of the most fashionable and well located parts of Central London. I have lived in the area for over seven years now and I can honestly say it's one of the best places that I've lived in the Capital [and there's been quite a few!]. I'm also a seasoned traveller and like to think I have a good feel for what guests are looking for in a travel accommodation experience.\r\nYour independent en-suite bedroom is like a small apartment and occupies a whole single floor of my house. It has its own lockable door and is directly accessible from the staircase. You also get the front door key. So you are completely independent. I live in one of the apartments, so if you want privacy and security here you have it or if you fancy a beer i can show you some local bars, restaurants and tourist sites.\r\nIn short you get a high quality en-suite double bedroom apartment, a bit like a hotel suite [linen, towels and toiletries are included and the bedroom is cleaned and prepared by a professional cleaner]. All at exceptionally competitive rates.",

The house is on a bus route - which is very convenient but can be a little noisy at night. <br /><br />There's one double bed, with an air bed and spare duvet in the cupboard.<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />Enti",

    "neighborhood_overview": "West Hampstead is, to all intents and purposes, just one street - West End Lane. It is located in the London Borough of Camden, in zone two of the London Underground.

The area is home to three train stations (all, confusingly, called West Hampstead!) and is a bona fide yuppie stronghold.<br />Though West Hampstead is hardly a place that springs to mind when you think nightlife, it has a smattering of good restaurants, pubs and bars. On the whole, the area's watering holes are towards the swankier (and pricier) end of the spectrum, and places tend to feel more mature feel than, say, Camden Town.<br /><br />In terms of nightclubs, Lately on West End Lane is a charming old-school dancing spot, whilst the Lower Ground Bar (also on West End Lane) flaunts its status as \"West Hampstead's Premi",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Yes Arsenal Football Stadium is a stones throw away, but there's so much more too! The area is becoming a real foodie haven with the opening of great cafes, dirty burger, the chicken shop, italian pizzeria where there's always a queue, coffee roasters, a fabulous wine and cheese shop, delicious vietnamese, famous chinese, bakeries, plus there's always the long standing a great local pubs. <br />If it's shopping you're after, you're in luck! If the enormous amount of shops along Upper Street doesn't work for you, jump on the overland train to Westfield, or bus to Camden, or tube to Oxford Street!<br />There's a classic old cinema 10 minutes walk to Holloway, or walk towards Angel for the more snazzy  Screen on the Green cinema (with sofas and a bar in the cinema!)",

The neighborhood is close to so many interesting areas, and is a great jumping off point to embark from.<br />I highly recommend a stay here!'<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />This is the spare room of a Victorian terraced house in a quiet street in a conservation area. The room is very peaceful (there's no traffic noise), at the back of the house, so overlooks my - and all the neighbouring -  gardens. <br />It is furnished with a very comfortable double bed, plenty of wardrobe space and an en suite shower and toilet. Clean bedding and towels are provided - and plenty of spare blankets and duvets, if people need them. There's also a hairdryer and an iron. It's a good sized room, with two radiators and two windows, providing great light. There is also excellent hi-speed wi-fi throughout the house. The house has recently been redecorated and there's new flooring in the guest room",

Just north of my area is Vauxhall, which has been christened 'VoHo' because of the mix of bohemian shops, gardens, cafes and bars. <br />It is also close to the American Embassy (25 minute walk) for guests needing to attend to visa applications.<br />Other cool neighbourhoods nearby are  Kennington, Clapham and Brixton. <br /><br />The Tate Britain gallery is just across the river and the South Bank Centre is a few stops away in the tube.",

    "description": "My place is great for couples, solo adventurers, business travellers, families, and groups. I have 3 double bedrooms I Airbnb & the website works out cost based on  everyone in one room. This works if you are solo or a couple, but if you require a second or third bedroom the cost will be incorrect and I will need to send you a new offer. Please be sure in your note to  let me know how many rooms you need and the configuration of guests. Thank you.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />Double room by Thames, SW London<br /><br />A lovely and spacious family house by the River Thames in Fulham, with a double room to rent and when available, two additional bedrooms for children or additional guests.  All bedrooms are spacious with TV, wifi and fantastic bus routes to central London from the end of the road.  Most of my bookings tend to come through this listing so if there is no availability showing here, it is still worth messaging me to see if one of the other rooms are free as I do have 3 l",
    "neighborhood_overview": "It is unique in so much as it is so close to the centre of London, but has a real feel of peace, quiet and country side. It is close to the river, where I regularly do a 7K run around the 2 bridges loop (takes about an hour to walk this), and Bishops Park is 5 mins away which has  a lovely Farmers Market every Sunday morning. There is a great local pub, The Crabtree, on the river 5 mins walk away and a great little corner shop for all your basic shopping requirements.  The famous River Cafe Restaurant is about a 10 minute walk away along the river and I can recommend many others.<br /><br />Jump on a bus at the top of the road and you can arrive at the great museums of South Kensington within 20 minutes and Piccadilly Circus is 15 minutes on the tube once you get to Hammersmith.",

I have three spare double rooms (depending on how many children are home), that are available for guests. They have separate listings so I can accommodate solo travelers up to a group of 6, depending on what is booked out. \n\nAlso, when we are all away, I rent the entire 5 bedroom house. We have 2 friendly cats who are part of the family too.\n\nI very much look forward to hearing from you and welcoming you to my home.",

    "host_about": "Hi, I'm Simon. Welcome to a collection of self contained studio suites located in one of the most fashionable and well located parts of Central London. I have lived in the area for over seven years now and I can honestly say it's one of the best places that I've lived in the Capital [and there's been quite a few!]. I'm also a seasoned traveller and like to think I have a good feel for what guests are looking for in a travel accommodation experience.\r\nYour independent en-suite bedroom is like a small apartment and occupies a whole single floor of my house. It has its own lockable door and is directly accessible from the staircase. You also get the front door key. So you are completely independent. I live in one of the apartments, so if you want privacy and security here you have it or if you fancy a beer i can show you some local bars, restaurants and tourist sites.\r\nIn short you get a high quality en-suite double bedroom apartment, a bit like a hotel suite [linen, towels and toiletries are included and the bedroom is cleaned and prepared by a professional cleaner]. All at exceptionally competitive rates.",

Tottenham Court Road is the major shopping street, and the best place in London to look for home furnishings and electronic goods. The area around Oxford Street mixes good high street shops with pubs and bars catching the overflow from Sohos nightlife.",

It's walking distance from the heart of London, and a lovely place to stay to get to know the city.<br /><br />Bloomsbury is famous for having been home to a number of Britain's creative writers, and as a hub for a bohemian group of people who included Virginia Woolf - the Bloomsbury Set. The streets around are peppered with blue plaques commemorating those who lived in this area, and there are various nearby attractions associated with writers, such as the Charles Dickens museum. The British Museum is a short walk away. <br /><br />Nearby amenities include some great restaurants, an excellent shopping centre with a Waitrose (UK's best) supermarket, an arthouse cinema, patisserie and chemist, a 24 hour grocery shop just across the road, and lots of good restaurants, pubs, and cafes.",
